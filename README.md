#Hello!

In order to use this app, do
`. start_project.sh`
If that gives errors regarding permission run
`chmod u+x start_project.sh`

It should run automatically on `localhost:5000` but in case you don't go straight to /tables, home will give you a small reminder to do `localhost:5000/table` 

Cheers!
